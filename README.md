## Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, designed for customer segmentation. The project was developed as part of a Data Mining course (Mineração de Dados) and leverages scikit-learn for clustering and matplotlib for data visualization.

## Overview

Overview
Customer segmentation is essential for targeted marketing and improved customer relationship management. This project applies the K-Means algorithm to group customers based on purchasing behavior and other relevant attributes, allowing for more focused business strategies.

## Features

- **Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic features.
- **K-Means Algorithm: Utilizes scikit-learn's KMeans class to perform clustering.
- **Data Visualization: Provides basic visualizations using matplotlib to help interpret and analyze clustering results.

## Technical Details

-  Programming Language: Python
    -  ibraries:
    -  scikit-learn for the K-Means implementation.
    -  matplotlib for data visualization.
    -  Pandas for data manipulation (if applicable).
  
-  Implementation: The project includes functions such as calculate_cluster_centers to compute cluster centroids and plot_clusters to visualize the segmented data.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook file customer_segmentation_k_means_pynb.ipynb to interact with the code.
Modify parameters such as the number of clusters or input data as needed to tailor the segmentation to your dataset.

## Future Improvements

-  Feature Engineering: Explore additional customer attributes to enhance segmentation.
-  Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize K-Means parameters (e.g., number of clusters, initialization methods) for improved performance.
-  Advanced Visualization: Integrate interactive visualizations for deeper data exploration.
-  Integration: Expand the project to include real-time data feeds for dynamic segmentation analysis.

## About
This project was developed for the course "Mineração de Dados" (Data Mining) and demonstrates a basic framework for performing customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
