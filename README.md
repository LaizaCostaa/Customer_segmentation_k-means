## Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This repository provides a Python-based implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. The code utilizes the scikit-learn library for efficient and robust clustering.

## Main Features

- **Customer Segmentation:** The code performs customer segmentation by grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant attributes.
- **K-Means Algorithm:** The core of the code is the K-Means algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique for clustering data points into groups.
- **Data Visualization:** The code includes basic data visualization functionalities to help understand the clustering results.

## Technical Details

The code implements the K-Means algorithm using the `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` class. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points to clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centroids. The code defines a function `calculate_cluster_centers` to determine the centroids of each cluster.

The code also includes a function `plot_clusters` to visualize the clusters. This function uses matplotlib to plot the data points and their assigned cluster labels.

## Final Considerations

The code provides a basic framework for customer segmentation using K-Means. Further improvements could include:

- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional features and attributes to improve the accuracy of the segmentation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the K-Means algorithm's hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple K-Means models for enhanced accuracy.
